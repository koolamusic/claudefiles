# Breadboarding: Procedures

## For Mapping an Existing System

See [examples.md](./examples.md) Example A for a complete worked example.

**Step 1: Identify the flow to analyze**

Pick a specific user journey. Always frame it as an operator trying to do something:
- "Land on /search, type query, scroll for more, click result"
- "Call the payment API with a card token, expect a charge to be created"

**Step 2: List all places involved**

Walk through the journey and identify each distinct place the user visits or system boundary crossed.

**Step 3: Trace through the code to find components**

Starting from the entry point (route, API endpoint), trace through the code to find every component touched by that flow.

**Step 4: For each component, list its affordances**

Read the code. Identify:
- UI: What can the user see and interact with?
- Code: What methods, subscriptions, stores are involved?

**Step 5: Name the actual thing, not an abstraction**

If you write "DATABASE", stop. What's the actual method? (`userRepo.save()`). Every affordance name must be something real you can point to in the code.

**Step 6: Fill in Control column**

For each affordance, what triggers it? (click, type, call, observe, write, render)

**Step 7: Fill in Wires Out**

For each affordance, what does it trigger? Read the code — what does this method call? What does this button's handler invoke?

**Step 8: Fill in Returns To**

For each affordance, where does its output flow?
- Functions that return values → list the callers that receive the return
- Data stores → list the affordances that read from them
- No meaningful output → use `—`

**Step 9: Add data stores as affordances**

When code writes to a property that is later read by another affordance, add that property as a Code affordance with control type `write`.

**Step 10: Add framework mechanisms as affordances**

Include things like `cdr.detectChanges()` that bridge between code and UI rendering. These show how state changes actually reach the UI.

**Step 11: Verify against the code**

Read the code again. Confirm every affordance exists and the wiring matches reality.

## For Designing from Shaped Parts

See [examples.md](./examples.md) Example B for a complete worked example including slicing.

**Step 1: List each part from the shape**

Take each mechanism/part identified in shaping and write it down.

**Step 2: Translate parts into affordances**

For each part, identify:
- What UI affordances does this part require?
- What Code affordances implement this part?

**Step 3: Verify every U has a supporting N**

For each UI affordance, check: what Code affordance provides its data or controls its rendering? If none exists, add the missing N.

**Step 4: Classify places as existing or new**

For each UI affordance, determine whether it lives in:
- An existing place being modified
- A new place being created

**Step 5: Wire the affordances**

Fill in Wires Out and Returns To for each affordance. Trace through the intended behavior — what calls what? What returns where?

**Step 6: Connect to existing system (if applicable)**

If there's an existing codebase:
- Identify the existing affordances the new ones must connect to
- Add those existing affordances to your tables
- Wire the new affordances to them

**Step 7: Check for completeness**

- Every U should have an N that feeds it
- Every N should have either Wires Out or Returns To (or both)
- Handlers → should have Wires Out
- Queries → should have Returns To
- Data stores → should have Returns To

**Step 8: Treat user-visible outputs as Us**

Anything the user sees (including emails, notifications) is a UI affordance and needs an N wiring to it.
